# SVG-Logo-Maker
Goal:

To generate a simple logo for projects so users don't have to pay a graphic designer


Description:
1. When the user is prompted for text, they can enter up to three characters
2. When the user is prompted for the text color, they can enter a color keyword (Or a hexadecimal number)
3. When the user is prompted for a shape, they are presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
4. When the user is prompted for the shape's color, they can enter a color keyword (Or a hexadecimal number)
5. When the user has entered input for all the prompts, an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` and the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
6. When the user opens the `logo.svg` file in a browser, they are shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria they entered
